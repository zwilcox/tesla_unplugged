I thought I'd throw a quick reference guide on the configuration of the xbee radios. I'll also put this in the git.

If you guys want, we can change the PAN ID.  We can change the addresses if we really want to.  Though these are already in our code base.  Though it would be hard to change. 

All:
PAN ID: 1337

Coordinator:
16-bit source address:  1234
Coordinator Enabled: Coordinator
API Enabled: 2 - API ENABLED W/PPP

End Points:
16-bit source address; 5678 and 9ABCD
Coordinator Enabled: 0 - END DEVICE
API Enabled: 2 - API ENABLED W/PPP
